## [0.99.31] - 2025-09-11

### Added
- CITATION file in `inst/CITATION` for proper package citation

### Changed
- Improved vignette chunk evaluation from 41% to 70.8% to meet Bioconductor requirements:
  * Introduction vignette: increased from 43% to 65% evaluated chunks
  * Advanced vignette: increased from 17% to 71% evaluated chunks (subsequently removed)
  * Visualization vignette: increased from 72% to 78% evaluated chunks
- Enabled evaluation of key demonstration chunks using mock data approach from package examples
- Removed advanced vignette to simplify package documentation and focus on main pipeline functions
- Simplified README by removing advanced usage sections and alternative implementation details
- Package now focuses on the two main exported functions: `scCulture()` and `plot_scCulture()`

### Fixed

## [0.99.30] - 2025-08-27

- Documentation site now builds correctly with the function renaming introduced in v0.99.29

## [0.99.29] - 2025-08-27

### Added
- Full SingleCellExperiment (SCE) support for Bioconductor compliance
- `load_sce_data()` function for direct SCE object loading and validation
- `handle_duplicates` parameter for robust handling of duplicate gene names in SCE data:
  * "make_unique" (default): Appends .1, .2, etc. to duplicate gene names
  * "aggregate": Sums expression values for duplicate genes
  * "first": Keeps only the first occurrence
  * "error": Stops with informative error if duplicates are found
- Flexible pathway matching for cross-dataset predictions

- Cross-dataset prediction capability with different gene sets
- Automatic pathway dimension alignment for incompatible datasets
- Comprehensive SCE workflow examples in documentation

### Changed
- Renamed `load_data()` to `load_10x_data()` for clarity and consistency with `load_sce_data()`
- Renamed function parameters for better clarity:
  * `data_dir` → `tenx_data_dir` to clearly indicate 10X data input
  * `sce_object` → `sce_data_path` to indicate it accepts both paths and objects
- Enhanced `predict_by_similarity()` to handle dimension mismatches gracefully
- Improved `calculate_prediction_confidence()` for flexible pathway matching
- Updated `predict_by_svm()` to align feature spaces between training and prediction
- Modified all scaling operations to use `safe_scale()` for zero-variance handling

- **KEGG pathway analysis** for biological interpretation and feature extraction
- **Similarity-based prediction algorithm** using correlation-based matching
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) prediction** with automatic feature handling
- **Prediction confidence scoring** [0;1] with edge case handling
- **Transferable fingerprint files** containing the trained model for culture media prediction, and pathway data

#### Data Integration
- Support for **CSV and 10X Genomics data formats** with and without appropriate headers
- **Seurat workflow integration**
- **Robust preprocessing pipeline** with normalization and scaling
- **Dimensionality reduction** using PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE
- **Metadata handling** with automatic sample detection

#### User Interface
- **Progress tracking** with minimal progress bars and detailed status messages
- **Parallel processing support** for computationally intensive tasks
- **Comprehensive input validation** with informative error messages
- **Verbose output options** for detailed analysis tracking
- **Visualization compatibility** with custom plotting function `plot_scCulture()`

#### Technical Infrastructure
- **Intelligent SVM fallback mechanism** - automatically switches to similarity-based predictions when SVM fails during prediction
- **Seurat v5 layer compatibility** with proper layer detection and handling
- **Memory-efficient processing** for large single-cell datasets
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Fixed

### Changed

- None in this initial release

### Security

#### Input Validation
- **Parameter type checking** for all user inputs
- **File existence validation** before processing
- **Data format verification** to prevent processing errors
- **Memory usage monitoring** for large dataset handling

### Known Issues

#### Documentation Date Discrepancy
- **DESCRIPTION file date error**: Version 0.99.0 was erroneously dated as 2024-04-28 in the DESCRIPTION file instead of the correct date 2025-06-20. This has been corrected in version 0.99.1.

#### SVM Prediction Limitations
- **Feature mismatch scenarios**: SVM prediction may fail when there are significant differences between training and prediction datasets (e.g., different gene coverage, pathway availability)
- **Impact on functionality**: All functionality is maintained even when SVM encounters issues, ensuring reliable predictions

#### Technical Limitations
- **Cross-dataset compatibility**: Best results achieved when training and prediction datasets have similar gene coverage
- **KEGG pathway dependency**: Requires KEGG pathway definitions for optimal performance
- **Seurat version compatibility**: Optimized for Seurat v4+ with v5 layer compatibility
