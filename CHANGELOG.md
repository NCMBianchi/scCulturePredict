### Changed
- Major code cleanup and refactoring:
  * Removed unused functions: `prepare_files_for_seurat()`, `load_packages()`

  * Deleted unused files: dimensionality_reduction.R, pathway_analysis.R, visualization.R

### Added
- New comprehensive test files for improved coverage:
  * `test-pipeline-full-params.R` - tests with all parameters enabled (26 tests)
  * `test-pipeline-errors.R` - tests error handling and edge cases (21 tests)
- Documentation for `transform_files.sh` shell script as optional utility

### Improved
- Test coverage expected to increase from 32.71% to ~50-55%

## [0.99.0] - 2025-06-20

### Added

#### Core Functionality
- **Dual-mode main function `scCulture()`** with BUILD and PREDICT modes
- **BUILD Mode**: Generate transferable transcriptomic fingerprints from labeled training data
- **PREDICT Mode**: Apply pre-built fingerprints to unlabeled datasets for culture condition prediction
- **KEGG pathway analysis** for biological interpretation and feature extraction
- **Similarity-based prediction algorithm** using correlation-based matching
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) prediction** with automatic feature handling
- **Prediction confidence scoring** [0;1] with edge case handling
- **Transferable fingerprint files** containing the trained model for culture media prediction, and pathway data

#### Data Integration
- Support for **CSV and 10X Genomics data formats** with and without appropriate headers
- **Seurat workflow integration**
- **Robust preprocessing pipeline** with normalization and scaling
- **Dimensionality reduction** using PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE
- **Metadata handling** with automatic sample detection

#### User Interface
- **Progress tracking** with minimal progress bars and detailed status messages
- **Parallel processing support** for computationally intensive tasks
- **Comprehensive input validation** with informative error messages
- **Verbose output options** for detailed analysis tracking
- **Visualization compatibility** with custom plotting function `plot_scCulture()`

#### Technical Infrastructure
- **Intelligent SVM fallback mechanism** - automatically switches to similarity-based predictions when SVM fails during prediction
- **Seurat v5 layer compatibility** with proper layer detection and handling
- **Memory-efficient processing** for large single-cell datasets
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Fixed

- None in this initial release

### Changed

- None in this initial release

### Security

#### Input Validation
- **Parameter type checking** for all user inputs
- **File existence validation** before processing
- **Data format verification** to prevent processing errors
- **Memory usage monitoring** for large dataset handling

### Known Issues

#### Documentation Date Discrepancy
- **DESCRIPTION file date error**: Version 0.99.0 was erroneously dated as 2024-04-28 in the DESCRIPTION file instead of the correct date 2025-06-20. This has been corrected in version 0.99.1.

#### SVM Prediction Limitations
- **Feature mismatch scenarios**: SVM prediction may fail when there are significant differences between training and prediction datasets (e.g., different gene coverage, pathway availability)
- **Impact on functionality**: All functionality is maintained even when SVM encounters issues, ensuring reliable predictions

#### Technical Limitations
- **Cross-dataset compatibility**: Best results achieved when training and prediction datasets have similar gene coverage
- **KEGG pathway dependency**: Requires KEGG pathway definitions for optimal performance
- **Seurat version compatibility**: Optimized for Seurat v4+ with v5 layer compatibility

### Deprecated
