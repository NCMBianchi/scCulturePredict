\description{
Checks if required packages are installed and installs them if they are not.
This function handles package checking and installation gracefully.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Checks if each package is installed using requireNamespace()
  \item Attempts to install missing packages using install.packages()
  \item Handles installation errors gracefully with warnings
}

This function is robust because it:
\itemize{
  \item Uses requireNamespace() instead of library()
  \item Handles installation errors without stopping
  \item Provides informative warning messages
}
}
\examples{
check_and_install_packages(c("Seurat", "dplyr", "ggplot2"))
