\title{Calculate pathway activities only (for PREDICT mode)}
\usage{
calculate_pathway_activities(seurat_object, kegg_pathways, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{seurat_object}{A Seurat object containing single-cell data.}

\item{kegg_pathways}{A list of KEGG pathways with gene names.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Whether to print progress messages (default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
A matrix of pathway activity scores with cells as rows and pathways as columns.
}
\description{
Calculates pathway activity scores for new data without building signature profiles.
This function is used in PREDICT mode where signature matrices are already available
from pre-built fingerprints.
}
\details{
This function performs only the pathway activity calculation part of fingerprint
building. It aggregates gene expression by pathway but does not create signature
profiles for different conditions. This is the appropriate function to use when
applying pre-built fingerprints to new unlabeled data.

\examples{
\donttest{
pathway_activities <- calculate_pathway_activities(seurat_object, kegg_pathways)
}
