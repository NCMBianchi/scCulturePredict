\description{
Predicts growth media conditions using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification.
}
\details{
This function implements a machine learning approach for predicting growth media
conditions using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. Unlike similarity-based
methods, SVM can capture more complex, non-linear relationships between pathway
expression patterns and growth conditions.

The workflow consists of:
\enumerate{
  \item Preparing data by removing NA values and combining with condition labels
  \item Splitting data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
  \item Scaling features to standardize the range and distribution
  \item Training an SVM model with radial basis function kernel
  \item Making predictions on the full dataset
  \item Evaluating model performance on the test set
}

The radial basis function kernel allows the SVM to capture non-linear relationships
in the data, potentially improving prediction accuracy over linear methods. The
function handles data preparation, model training, prediction, and evaluation
in an integrated workflow.
