Description: A simple R package to build a phenotypic fingerprint and subsequentially
    predict cell culture based on gene expression and biological pathways from
    single-cell transcriptomics data: a dual functionality in BUILD and PREDICT modes.
    The first generates transferable transcriptomic fingerprints from labeled training
    data using KEGG pathway analysis and trains both similarity-based and SVM prediction
    models. The latter applies these pre-built fingerprints to unlabeled datasets for
    culture condition prediction. Supports both CSV and 10X Genomics data formats,
    integrates with Seurat workflows, and provides comprehensive visualisation tools
    for model evaluation and prediction confidence assessment.
